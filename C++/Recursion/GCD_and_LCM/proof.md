If two integers ${\color{blue}A}$ and ${\color{blue}B}$ are not coprime, let's say their greatest common divisor is ${\color{red}gcd}$.

A = gcd * a

B = gcd * b

integers ${\color{blue}a}$ and ${\color{blue}b}$ are coprime.

A - B = gcd * a - gcd * b = gcd * (a - b)

assume ${\color{blue}(a}$ ${\color{blue}-}$ ${\color{blue}b)}$ is not coprime with ${\color{blue}b}$, so assume ${\color{red}k}$ is their greatest common divisor

	(a - b) = k * i

	b       = k * j

then A - B = A - gcd * b = A - gcd * k * j = gcd * (a - b) = gcd * k * i

then A = gcd * k * i + gcd * k * j = gcd * k * (i + j)

and &nbsp;B = gcd * k * j

that contradict ${\color{red}gcd}$ is the greatest common divisor of ${\color{blue}A}$ and ${\color{blue}B}$

so ${\color{blue}(a}$ ${\color{blue}-}$ ${\color{blue}b)}$ must coprime with ${\color{blue}a}$ and ${\color{blue}b}$

then the greatest common divisor ${\color{red}gcd}$ of integers ${\color{blue}A}$ and ${\color{blue}B}$ is also the greatest common divisor of they and ${\color{blue}(A}$ ${\color{blue}-}$ ${\color{blue}B)}$.
